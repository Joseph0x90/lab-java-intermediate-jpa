Here is 3 tasks that can be accomplished with native SQL that you cannot do woth JPQL: 
1- Database Specific Functions and Operations. 
 * JPQL is designed to be database-agnostic.
2- Complex Queries Involving Multipile Joins and Subqueries.
 * JPQL has limitations in terms of complexity and readability when dealing with deeply nested queries. 

3- Database schema manipulation and DDL Operations. 
 * JPQL is purely for querying and managing data, not altering the database schema.
